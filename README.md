# **Ballz**

A loose clone of the [Ketchapp](http://www.ketchappstudio.com/) game.

- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.ballz)

## Tips
- If the balls sometimes have straight edges, lower the frame rate cap in "Settings"
- If you want to speed up or slow down the game, lower or raise the physics refresh delay in "Settings"
  - A lower delay means that the balls will move faster
